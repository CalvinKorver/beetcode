```javascript
supabase: {
  url: 'https://hukfgtczrtllqhlahuar.supabase.co',
  publishableKey: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...' // Verify this is correct
}
```

3. If using a different Supabase project for production, update these values

### Step 1.3: Update Manifest Version (Optional)

If this is an update to an existing extension:

1. Open `manifest.json`
2. Increment the version number:
```json
"version": "1.0.1"  // or "1.1.0" for features, "2.0.0" for breaking changes
```

## Phase 5: Post-Publication OAuth Setup

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL STEP:** This must be done after extension is published!

### Why This is Necessary

When your extension is published to the Chrome Web Store, it gets a **permanent extension ID** that's different from your development/unpacked extension ID. OAuth redirect URLs must match this new production ID.

### Step 5.1: Get Production Extension ID

**After your extension is approved and published:**

1. Go to [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore)

2. Search for "Beetcode" (or go to your extension's store page)

3. **Option A:** Look at the URL
   ```
   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/[EXTENSION_ID_HERE]
   ```
   The extension ID is the long string in the URL

4. **Option B:** Install and check
   - Install the extension from Chrome Web Store
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Look under your extension name for "ID: [extension_id]"

5. **Save this ID** - you'll need it for OAuth setup

**Your redirect URL will be:**
```
https://[EXTENSION_ID].chromiumapp.org/
```

### Step 5.2: Update Supabase Redirect URL

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/)

2. Select your project: `hukfgtczrtllqhlahuar`

3. Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**

4. Under **Redirect URLs**, click **"Add URL"**

5. Paste your production redirect URL:
   ```
   https://[YOUR_EXTENSION_ID].chromiumapp.org/
   ```

6. Click **"Save"**

7. **Keep your development redirect URL** (don't delete it if you want to continue local dev)

### Step 5.3: Update Google Cloud Console

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

2. Select your project

3. Navigate to: **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**

4. Find OAuth 2.0 Client ID: `699635422526-ijgogea6agkjj987slnfqpkcjb5f7h3h`

5. Click to edit it

6. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click **"Add URI"**

7. Paste your production redirect URL:
   ```
   https://[YOUR_EXTENSION_ID].chromiumapp.org/
   ```

8. Click **"Save"**

### Step 5.4: Verify OAuth Configuration

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Production extension ID obtained from Chrome Web Store
- [ ] Redirect URL added to Supabase
- [ ] Redirect URL added to Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Both URLs match exactly (including trailing slash)
